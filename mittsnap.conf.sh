# Sources to backup from
# A list of <protocol> <source> <target>
# <protocol>:
#   snapshot - makes a snapshot of a btrfs subvolume
#   local - rsync from local source
#   ssh - rsync over ssh
#   script - runs a script and backups files in the current directory
# <source>: Source subvolume or rsync path
#   note that rsync splits the path at a /./ and only retains what comes after it
# <target>: Location in backup
#   snapshots will be stored to BACKUP_ROOT/daily.0/<target>
#   local and ssh will be stored to BACKUP_ROOT/daily.0/local/<target>
#
# Ex:
# SOURCES="
# snapshot /data/photos photos
# local /home/./thomasloven server/homedir
# ssh thomas@laptop:/home/./thomas laptop/homedir
# script /path/to/executable database/dumps
